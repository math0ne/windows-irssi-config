This is my dedicated stand alone drupal irssi setup. Here are some features:

    * Autoconnects to irc.freenode.net
    * Joins my fav channels #php and #drupal
    * Included customized and configured version of Console
    * Custom reshacked system tray icon
    * Custom irssi theme

You can of course easily change which channels and networks it joins by consulting the irssi documentation.
